3/8/24, 3:41 PM - Nophina Akka NFC: 1. What distinguishes genuinely encountering God's presence from merely being stirred by impressive musical performances or arrangements. It's often difficult to understand. While music can bring strong emotions, it doesn't necessarily convey God's presence; only Jesus can do that. However, God has pledged to reside among his followers, and he desires us to deeply appreciate this truth.

2. The passage also encourages being attentive and receptive to the leading of the Spirit, actively listening for His guidance as they minister to others. By allowing the Spirit to work through them, they honor both the Son (Jesus) and bring glory to the Father.

3. Studying  God’s Word in personal devotions is very important, also it is more important to remember in public and applying in our daily life. Pray over the lyrics before the worship starts as we will be the one leading the worship. Spirit’s active presence is much important as it involves others as-well. If any spontaneous is to be done let’s do with responsibly, humbly and this is one more way we can lead the church in cherishing God’s presence in our midst.
3/9/24, 11:00 AM - +91 97381 52660: Dear Team, Grateful for your support today. Let's meet for practice tomorrow at 8 am. Thanks!

3/12/24, 9:33 AM - Rachit Bhaiya: Hi Team,
As I read the above portion, it brings in such a new perspective. We must worship God with the thought the very soon, we will worship Him in heaven where in glory and majesty will be revealed to us in a special way. 

Everything on earthly realm has short comings but where are we looking at? Things temporary or things which are eternal, in heaven with our Lord.

Please read the weekly portion. 
I loved what the writer says in one of the portions here that:

*Worship that approaches God casually loses sight of this truth. In our sincere desire to help others view God as approachable, we must not forget that God is wholly unlike us.*

We will look at many a topics such as reverence and why the essence of it must not be lost in worship! 

Happy reading all.

”Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.“
‭‭1 John‬ ‭4‬:‭7‬-‭10‬ ‭NIV‬‬

7/1/24, 8:19 AM - Rachit Bhaiya: Hi Team, 
Please read the weekly portion. We continue reading on physical expressions on worship and what must be kept in mind while doing so.

I would like to remind this portion to each one of us. 
“*People in your church will learn the most from what is modeled by you and the other leaders. Churches rarely rise above the level of their leaders in expressiveness and genuine engagement. That's the way God designed the church.*”

As a worship team, we must model physical expressions and Godly alignment in worship and beyond. 

Have a great week. <This message was edited>

7/17/24, 7:22 PM - Rachit Bhaiya: Weekly portion for our perusal. 
I love what the writer states. Worship starts with God and ends with Him. 

This is the reason why the flow of our songs are also that way, lyrically but more so, that’s where we are called upon to be from the position of our hearts. Is God the one and only element in my personal and corporate worship? 

Let’s read about the vertical and horizontal aspects of worship

*Jesus our Living Water*

*John 4:24* - God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth.

Jesus, as the Living Water, offers the gift of the Holy Spirit. Just as water is essential for life, the Holy Spirit is essential for true spiritual life and worship. By receiving Jesus, the Living Water, we are filled with the Holy Spirit, who empowers us to worship God authentically and truthfully. In this way, Jesus leads us to worship in spirit and in truth, aligning our hearts with God's true nature.

We follow a long line of worshipper who believe the same things. Adotpion of old hymns/ liturgies only re-emphasises that faith. When we gather to worship God, the assembly of first borns who are already in heaven are also a part of worship.

9/4/24, 9:05 AM - Rachit Bhaiya: Loved the idea and agree that: 

The quest for excellence should not become an idol but there must be a healthy tension between a heart to worship and our skills. Bringing excellence to God is good but chasing perfection while forgetting about God is vain if through our excellence we do not spotlight the glory of God, specifically more so in worship. 

Happy reading all. <This message was edited>

Please find the theme and song list for this week.

*Theme: His blood sets us free!*

Romans 8:15
For you have not received a spirit of slavery leading to fear again, but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out, ‘Abba!  Father! 

 *1.My redeemer lives -* https://youtu.be/3glYEDzSyok?si=ttu9vZn0jXMd6K5t

 *2.Because he lives -* https://youtu.be/RFIr8-gH55E?si=5wvh9e8a8E43J1cw

 *3.I speak Jesus -* https://youtu.be/PcmqSfr1ENY?si=0oplfyzx4waiUD77

 *4.Living hope -* https://youtu.be/rc5wtRjgaI8?si=8jP30LPS6uLx8wlg

Please let me know if any changes required.☺️
10/9/24, 9:27 AM - Rachit Bhaiya: Hey Joyanna, 

Quick thoughts:

Song 2
Recommend this instead of Becuase He lives. 
https://youtu.be/LfzpfqrPUDo?si=wwN_Y9sTeZ9xH0SF

Because He Lives is more of a worship song than a traditional praise song. While praise songs primarily focus on exalting God’s attributes and glory, Because He Lives centers on the personal hope and assurance that believers have because of Jesus’ resurrection. It reflects themes of faith, trust, and overcoming fear through Christ’s victory over death.

Song 3: Take your current song 4, Living hope as your song 3. It can be core to your theme. 

Song 4: 
King of Kings
https://youtu.be/jbZMMd99nM8?si=E541GokJBVNT33ju

Recommend this. I speak Jesus is not flowing with the theme you have picked up. 

Let me know should you want to have a quick chat. :) <This message was edited>

2/3/25, 4:53 PM - Ashok Uncle: Dear friends of south n central, the idea of this reading is that you are growing as a leader in your walk with God hence there is a serious to these postings.
1.  It is based on your integrity and walk with God which i get to know as your post.
2.  You are supposed to be mediating and then waiting on God and absorb the learnings before posting.
3.  For example you are not supoosed to download these from tools such as chat gpg etc...😂as that would amount to deception and eventually your life is on a downward slope😊
4.  The primary purpose is your character is shaped by these readings and posting.
I hope and pray you understand this as worship team is supposed be surrounded by His Holiness. 
5.  I read these as and when they are posted.
Hope this helps and want to see some genuine posts of your learnings 😊🙏
2/3/25, 4:54 PM - Rachit Bhaiya: Hi Team, 
Please read the weekly portion and as reminder by Uncle, do take some time to genuinely meditate of these readings and build our foundations/ reflections on the actual Word of God.

Additionally, I understand that we are aligned with the worship set and I am posting it out. <This message was edited>

2/10/25, 11:28 AM - Anshika Didi Nfc: Hi Team,
Please find the worship set and theme for this week below. Please let me know your feedbacks. 

*Theme - The Vastness of God’s Grace*

2 Corinthians 12:9–10
But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me. For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities. For when I am weak, then I am strong.

1- God is great

2/14/25, 6:29 PM - Rachit Bhaiya: Sure, Anshika
2/14/25, 6:52 PM - Berly Akka NFC: Sure Anshika
2/14/25, 7:26 PM - Berly Akka NFC: Thank you Anshika for the share 
Good reminder that we should do reflective listening and about the thought process behind sing selection / suggestion.
2/14/25, 7:44 PM - Rachit Bhaiya: My major take aways came from page 224. On selecting songs (new or old). Listing them below. 

*1. Key Considerations for Selecting Worship Songs*
Understand the Song’s Impact

Ask what stood out to the person—lyrics, melody, or a personal connection.

Identify how the song might serve the congregation’s spiritual needs.

*2. Evaluate the Song Carefully*
Listen closely and assess its theological soundness.

Seek input from other worship leaders for a well-rounded perspective.

Avoid choosing songs based solely on popularity rather than substance.

*3. Consider Clarity and Theological Depth*
Ensure the lyrics clearly communicate biblical truth.

Avoid songs with vague, confusing, or misleading theological implications.

Example: In Above All, “you took the fall” may sound too casual, and “thought of me above all” might misrepresent Christ’s primary purpose.

*4. Assess Musical and Congregational Fit*

Check if the melody is singable and accessible for the congregation.

Ensure the song’s style complements the church’s worship culture and existing setlist. <This message was edited>

Weekly portion for your reading and reflection.👆🏼 <This message was edited>
2/17/25, 10:56 AM - Berly Akka NFC: My takeaways : 

Church / individuals  should be open to adjusting our worship practices and style over time, based on biblical principles, to better align with God's desires and reach our community more effectively, while ensuring the core elements of authentic worship remain central. 

Here, the writer says we can’t assume everyone understands what true worship is. 
Or assume any change is small / insignificant. 

He again lays an emphasis on reiterating the need of practising true worship. 
Teach it and live it <This message was edited>

2/20/25, 10:31 PM - Rachit Bhaiya: My Key Takeaways

Teach Biblical Worship Regularly – Help the church understand and remember the purpose of worship through preaching, brief explanations. 

Lead with Theology & Humility – Use changes (e.g., music style, song repetition) as teaching moments. Be open to feedback but remain confident in well-discerned decisions.

Introduce New Songs Wisely – Teach songs in a way that highlights their biblical truth, not just their musical appeal. Use methods like singing the chorus first or introducing them gradually.

Love the Church as God Does – See the congregation as God’s treasured people. Lead with patience, grace, and a heart aligned with God’s love for His church. <This message was edited>
2/21/25, 7:52 AM - +91 79038 33102: Amazing time of reading, my top key takeaways are:
- Our focus should be to sing songs that exalt God’s glory in Christ in the clearest and best ways. This approach will always enable us to select the right kind of songs for worship.
- ⁠Biblical worship is an awe inspiring, life changing experience and we must always aim for that (giving our best offering to God) rather than the same-as every week cold worship.
- ⁠Introduce new songs to celebrate who God is rather than just the music or the song- Checking our intentions behind taking new songs.
- ⁠God never gets tired of our almost in tune-somewhat together faith filled worship. He loves His church and He is always at work to reveal His glorious wisdom through the church. <This message was edited>
2/21/25, 10:34 AM - Pastor Manu: <Media omitted>
As i came across this verse from Proverbs during my quiet time, i was blessed to see how most of you have responded well to the instructions given by the worship leader in such a short time. I’m glad the worship team, has wisdom being displayed brightly through their actions.
2/21/25, 11:00 AM - Nophina Akka NFC: My Key takeaways from page 225-228
   
1. Any changes we make it is always very important to keep the leaders in agreement. In my understanding always important to have a word with worship leader also the pastor to keep him aware about the changes rather than taking the changes in our own hands
2. Introducing new songs is always focused on God first and not on the music. It is also important how we introduce to the congregation. We can teach them line by line or either ask them to sing chorus and then the remaining parts.
3. Love the church because our God does,because Ephesians 3:10 says  His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God. People sees as nothing special but God sees as treasured possession. We are precious in his sight. Whatever we do God sees our heart of worship.
2/21/25, 11:24 AM - Vikranth Bhaiya NFC: Key takeaways from the weekly reading...

- Change is welcome but cannot be presented as a surprise rather it has to be well thought about and introduced clearly in agreement with the leaders. What works elsewhere might or might not workout for all. 
- To be reminded and to remind what worship is all about, to not get 'used to the feeling' of worship being a regular thing. 
- To be mindful of the congregation while introducing new songs, to be able to ease then into the new song rather than bombarding them with too much newness in the environment.
- To check the lyrics of the songs against their theological principles and be rooted in the word. 
- To see all as how God would see them, precious and treasured possessions. To love the church as he would.
2/21/25, 1:13 PM - Aaron Mathew: My key Takeaways from the reading :

1. Keeping the heart of worship in focus - Worship is not about the singing or the music. It’s about keeping God at the centre. Reminding ourselves and the congregation why we worship is required to prevent it from becoming routine.
2. Introduce new songs with Purpose - New songs should be chosen for their biblical depth and not just because it sounds good or has a good melody/rhythm. Taking time to explain the lyrics helps people connect with the message behind the music
3. Leading with humility - Leading with Humble confidence is key. Leading with patience, grace and a heart that mirrors Gods love creates a space where we can truly experience him. God does not mind off tune singing or playing. True worship comes from the heart of surrender. <This message was edited>
2/21/25, 1:41 PM - Suni Aunty: Good takeaways Aaron . Just something I thought can be looked into . The 3rd point under Leading with humility. It is ok to sing or play off tune in your personal times as God sees your heart . 
   But when you are leading , your off tune singing and playing will cause distraction to the congregation. When we lead we do everything possible to help people to focus ☺️
    That is why it is so important to practice, practice and come for the worship rehearsal. 
      That is the difference between Personal times of worship and leading people during corporate worship. ☺️🙏
2/21/25, 1:48 PM - Aaron Mathew: Noted aunty. Thanks a lot for the correction over the point put up 😊. <This message was edited>
2/21/25, 1:56 PM - Anshika Didi Nfc: My takeaways for this week’s reading. 

1- Waiting when you have any new ideas or suggestions for the worship. Often there are times we are quick to introduce our thoughts but our leaders know better and maybe why the idea may have not been implemented and for the right reasons as well.

2- Humble confidence is a new word I came across while reading. Receiving negative feedback does not always have to be bad. 

3- While we see ourselves as normal people praising God, our Father loves each one of us like his own. We are his prized possession. We should see each other the same way that God does.

2/21/25, 3:00 PM - Nophina Akka NFC: Works for me Berls
2/21/25, 3:10 PM - Aaron Mathew: Works for me as well akka
2/21/25, 3:28 PM - +91 94809 96400: My takeaway for this week’s portion.

Our worship should be be God - centered and not man centered. Not selecting songs with too many themes.

Introducing change to the congregation to teach biblical worship. Faith filled encounter with God every week. Focus on the truth of the songs and not emotions on the music.

To be encouraged in the love of Christ.
2/22/25, 1:02 AM - Hanish Anna Nfc: My takeaways:
# Worship is for the Lord and when you worship Him and call him from your heart we will feel His presence via Holy Spirit.
# Knowing what Biblical worship resides a very important factor as a church. 
# New songs circling around Biblical path and His words really makes a big difference as those gives a hope and peace in heart more than just a song.
2/22/25, 5:43 AM - Joyanna Akka NFC: My takeaways for this week's portion:

-Whenever we get an innovative idea or creative plan to introduce to the church We have to make sure that the leaders are in agreement and discuss with them beforehand.

-Regularly teaching the church what biblical worship is- it doesn't matter how mature a church is they'll need to be reminded how worship is biblically. We need to be reminded what a life- altering, awe inspiring event worshipping God really is, we can share a brief comment while we are leading the worship on some aspects of why we worship.

-When God looks at his people, he sees them at his treasured possession. They are precious in his sight. May they be precious in our sight as well. <This message was edited>
2/22/25, 7:55 AM - Samuel Anna Nfc: My take away for this week's portion : 

Bringing the Change to the Church by song or by the music. It should be the biblical way. 
The lyrics, the music is to worship God. To tell how great our god is. Includes all like love of God, grace , miracles, peace, strength, power, kindness, etc.


Discuss with elders like pastors, and with the worship leaders, because of whether we are taking the right song at the right time.

2/24/25, 9:32 PM - Rachit Bhaiya: Pages 230-231 are perhaps the most important reading portions in this entire book to me personally. 

My takeaways:

1. Lead by Example – Worship is not just music; our lives should reflect the gospel.

2. Heart Over Skill – Worship is about devotion to Jesus,*not just* musical excellence alone. 

3. Clear Commitment – Team members must be church members, spiritually growing, and accountable.

4. Excellence with Integrity – Be faithful, punctual, humble, and committed to improving.

5. Spiritual Standards First – Musical talent should never outweigh godly character. While both are important, the latter is a non-negotiable. <This message was edited>
2/24/25, 9:34 PM - Berly Akka NFC: Thank you Anshika. 

My takeaways : 
1. Team standards : 
Worship lead / member are held to a *stricter standard for character* - not flawless rather demonstrating the fruit of the gospel. 
In ministry, heart of worship > art of worship. 

2. Worship isn’t a gig, it’s an overflow of life dedicated to the glory of the Lord. 

3. Clear instructions of our values / standards that is expected and practiced. 

4. Level of commitment is absolutely necessary but not at the compromise of our priorities. “God’s work done in God’s way will never lack God’s supply “. There are seasons of giving more, seasons where we need to step back and take it easy. Choose to act wisely, humbly and honourably.
2/25/25, 10:22 AM - Nophina Akka NFC: Thanks Anshika
2/25/25, 11:21 AM - Aaron Mathew: Thank you anshika didi
2/25/25, 5:51 PM - Hanish Anna Nfc: Thanks Anshika.
2/25/25, 10:11 PM - +91 94809 96400: My takeaway for this week’s portion:

By setting standards in the worship team to showcase our lives demonstrating fruit of gospel. 
 
Congregation receives the right message about music is to imply the heart and not art of worship, without minimizing the spiritual maturity for the sake of musical excellence.

 Spiritual standards in growing their knowledge  and love for God.
  
Prioritize God’s work, encouraging team for their faithfulness with Godly examples.
2/26/25, 9:50 AM - Anshika Didi Nfc: Hi Team. As there are no feedbacks I will post this out in the church group.
2/28/25, 3:44 PM - Anshika Didi Nfc: Hi Team. Can we all meet at 8:15am tomorrow?
2/28/25, 3:44 PM - Rachit Bhaiya: Works for us
2/28/25, 4:32 PM - +91 94809 96400: Sure Anshika.

2/28/25, 11:12 PM - Vikranth Bhaiya NFC: Thank you Anshika.

Key take aways 

- leading worship is beyond just perfecting our music but it also requires us to strengthen our spiritual lives. 
- Our lives have to emulate the fruits of the spirit. As worship team our lives/character defines worship to others. Heart over art.
- Spiritual maturity > musical excellence. 
- Commitment  - reorientation of priorities. God's work done in God's way will never lack God's supply.

3/1/25, 8:42 PM - Nophina Akka NFC: *Takeaways from 229-232*

1. This chapter also takes about technical person in the group where it says there must be clear communication between the technical details and the team. 

2. Even the musicians aren’t necessary to be elders or teachers, it is important to present in front of the congregation. When this segment fails worship turns into music.

3. No matter how big we grow spiritually growth and maintaining that aim is necessary. Not to trade off our spiritual maturity when in the large numbers.

3/3/25, 8:36 PM - Hanish Anna Nfc: Thanks Vikranth.
3/3/25, 9:05 PM - Hanish Anna Nfc: Thanks for sharing Vikranth. Take-aways from myside:

1. Encouraging one-another is very important as it naturally pushes us to go above and beyond for serving the Lord.

2. Looking out for more opportunities in different ways to worship the Lord (Let’s say just vocals with minimal instruments for a whole 4th song) which could possibly elevate the overall worship.

3. Practicing through the week is very important and it brings reverence with values.

4. Welcoming feedback improves as an individual and as a team.
3/4/25, 10:21 AM - Vikranth Bhaiya NFC: Key take aways 

- We need to show honour to each other by encouraging each other. This we are to do by being mindful of what is happening around us and take time to appreciate the efforts by fellow worship team members. 
- Growth both theological and musical is important but that shouldn't make us rigid to others but make us to be more considerate while participating. 
- Rehearsals should not be used for practising the instruments but for setting the dynamics between the members. Rehearsals are to be used as times of calibrating ourselves to the team and growing together.
3/4/25, 10:54 AM - Berly Akka NFC: Thanks Vikranth! 

My takeaways: 

1. The body of Christ must be edified in order to support one another.  Let's surpass one another in displaying honor.  

2. Together, let's foster a culture of development and accept challenges in both music and theology.  

3. Let's invest in one another, shoulder each other's burdens, and walk hand in hand.  In time, this can transcend music.
3/7/25, 9:27 AM - Rachit Bhaiya: My takeaways: 

1.*Encourage Grace, Not Criticism* – Focus on recognizing and affirming God’s work in each other rather than pointing out weaknesses. Celebrate faithfulness, servanthood, and dedication.

2.*Create a Culture of Honor* - Regularly express gratitude, whether through words, notes, or public acknowledgment. Romans 12:10 reminds us to “outdo one another in showing honor.”

3.*Prioritize Relationships Over Tasks* – Take time to check in on team members’ lives, pray for them, and be aware of their struggles and victories. Worship is about people, not just music.

4.*Equip for Growth* – Encourage reading, listening, and skill-building through books, lessons, and structured learning.

5.*Balance Musical Excellence with Humility* – Encourage both trained and untrained musicians to grow in their skills while fostering mutual respect. Develop a common musical language for better collaboration.

6.*Practice Smart, Not Just Often* – Rehearsals should be purposeful, incorporating new songs, prayer, skill-building, and team bonding. Personal practice outside of rehearsals is a must. 

7.*Evaluate with Humility* – Foster a culture where feedback is welcomed and personal growth is a priority.
3/7/25, 9:31 AM - Vikranth Bhaiya NFC: Hi team as there are no feedbacks will post it out in the church group..
3/7/25, 8:35 PM - +91 94809 96400: My takeaways:

Emulate his image by honoring and encouraging each other as a team.

Spiritual growth to equip ourselves as a team by sharing and how works it out in our lives.

Musical growth - To see everyone growing in their skill as a team to serve God. 

Rehearse smartly accordingly to the needs  and practice outside rehearsals.

Evaluating the team with humility.

3/10/25, 10:35 AM - Nophina Akka NFC: Takeaways from 233-236

1. Encourage each and everyone even a small grace of action.                                                 
2. It’s always important to highlight qualities and characteristics, be it be humility, long time faithfulness,servant hood, godliness and joy.  While high lighting this point I was really moved by all of us hold the heart towards God as a team. Hereby I would like to highlight few of our qualities we hold as a team together .                                                Ankita every single week preparing black coffee for the entire team. Rachit for his rock solid support. Samuel for being so humble, Vikranth for being thoughtfulness, Anshika and Joyanna for being  supportive and understanding, Aaron for being all rounder and encouraging in all the ways, Sreekar for being such a smiling face to receive each and everyone, Berly for being patience and humility, Hanish for being a encourager  in the team. 
3. Practice throughout the week is must. 
4. Welcome the feedback to improve ourselves.
3/10/25, 10:37 AM - Nophina Akka NFC: Thank you Hanish 

Here are my Takeaways from 237-240
1. *Musical Presentations* : It is good practice for the team to gather post worship along with the sounds person to encourage each other at first and then to understand  what missed out. This helps to keep improving to serve the best for God. Also take opportunity to thank media and sounds team who work tirelessly and joyfully 😀
2. *Character* : GODLY CHARACTER is more important than their musicianship.
3. *Enjoying the team*: let the team has 2, 20 or 200 always remember that we have to serve faithfully to our God. When we faithfully and humbly serve we can expect the harvest in growing each other by serving in God’s kingdom. Speaking of harvest here, what kind of harvest it is ? A church encountering Jesus Christ on every Sundays and everyday. That’s the richest harvest
3/10/25, 12:26 PM - +91 94809 96400: My takeaways from this week’s portion.

Consistent evaluation given graciously is very effective for the musical growth in the team to work positively.

Having Godly attitude is more important than great musicianship.

Serving God with the gifts given to us by greater motivation to improve.

Leading a team faithfully and humbly reaps rich harvest. <This message was edited>
3/12/25, 9:44 AM - Hanish Anna Nfc: Good morning everyone. As no further feedback posting it in the main group, thanks.
3/12/25, 10:02 AM - Rachit Bhaiya: *Takeaways*

*Consistent Evaluation* 
Regular feedback after services helps us improve while reminding us that all we do is by God’s grace. Encouragement and constructive critique keep us humble and growing.

*Godly Character Matters*
Skills are valuable, but a heart of humility, gratitude, and faithfulness is what truly honors God. Pride and self-centered attitudes should never be excused.

*Gifting and Growth*
Being on the team is not the finish line; we should constantly strive to improve. If God brings in more gifted people, we should welcome them with humility, knowing He has a place for each of us to serve.

*Enjoy the Journey*
Strong teams are built through shared service, joy, and commitment to God’s mission.

*Faithful Leadership Bears Fruit*
Leading a worship team comes with challenges, but when done with faithfulness, humility, and perseverance, it produces a rich harvest—musicians who love the gospel, a church that magnifies Christ, and a team that glorifies God together.
3/13/25, 9:15 PM - Vikranth Bhaiya NFC: Key takeaways 

- Consistent evaluation is a key part of growth. It is good to start with encouragement and then move to the things that could've been better. We are accountable to pursue Godly character. Rigidity to correction is not expected, we are to express humility and grace. 
- Gifting is not a destination but a journey, we are to grow in our skills. Gifting can often not catchup with the church's growth. God requires excellence, we need to be prepared to step up or step aside when we see that there are others more gifted in a particular area.
- We are a team and we need to and are expected to hold each other up, as we grow in love for the gospel, for each other and for serving in the church.

3/17/25, 9:11 PM - +91 79038 33102: My takeaways:
- Our Pastors are gifts from ascended Christ to equip the church for ministry and hence we need to obey them and submit to them.
- ⁠We must always heed to our pastor’s opinions on worship. If he wants us the worship set to be in a certain way (under a certain time in which case I may need to cut down on a song, shorten the time we sing etc) or suggest anything that would be for the best of the overall order of the service, we must humbly adhere to it.
- ⁠While we can ask our worship leaders for direction and clarity on when we lead worship but asking our Pastor on how we can lead our worship so that we are scripturally aligned is of utmost importance.
3/18/25, 7:44 PM - +91 94809 96400: My takeaways from the portion given:

Understanding the need of the Pastor in leading the worship and how the worship team has to be built and accept with a submissive heart as pastors are gift to leading us into our spiritual growth. 
Support him by praying for him and his family fervently.

Listen to him with discerning ears on what he’s emphasizing to tell us , where we have to improvise.
3/18/25, 8:07 PM - Ashok Uncle: Excellent read and views, The key to Christian Maturity is obedience to Jesus and the good shepherds of the flock. Very theological material. :)
3/19/25, 7:13 AM - Anshika Didi Nfc: My takeaways for this week’s reading:

1- Pastors are a gift from God to all of us and though it may seem that we are in the backend of the work, we all have a place in Gods plan. And here, it is to support our pastors.
2- Submitting to our pastors should be done joyfully and not with a heavy heart. For the pastors too, we should be a joy for them and whenever they need us we must submit joyfully. Making their job a joy is our responsibility.
3- Asking for direction and clarity is not going to make us small or give anyone the feeling that we don’t know. 
4- We should always keep our pastors in prayer knowing that they uphold the church and they are the ones accountable to God.
3/19/25, 9:16 AM - Ashok Uncle: 😊🙏
3/19/25, 9:28 AM - Rachit Bhaiya: My takeaways. 

*Pastors Have Different Leadership Styles*
Some are highly involved in worship planning, while others take a hands-off approach. Worship leaders need to adapt to their pastor’s leadership style.

*Pastors Are Gifts from God*
Ephesians 4:11-12 describes pastors as gifts to equip the church, while worship leaders are called to support them. 

*Serve Your Pastor, Not Your Agenda*
The pastor holds ultimate responsibility for the church’s direction, including worship. Worship leaders should prioritize their pastor’s vision over personal preferences. Seeking clarity from the pastor is not a sign of weakness but a way to serve better.

*Worship Is a Team Effort, But the Pastor Has the Final Say*
Worship leaders should present song choices as suggestions, not demands. They should be flexible with last-minute changes and not take them personally.

*Prayer Is the Best Way to Support a Pastor*
Worship leaders should consistently pray for their pastor’s well-being, family, and leadership. *They should care about the entire church service, not just the musical portion.*

*Listen to Your Pastor Actively*
Avoid pushing personal preferences without first understanding the pastor’s perspective. *Pay attention to sermons and conversations to understand the Pastor’s values and vision.*

*Humility and Flexibility Are Key*
Worship leaders should welcome feedback, even if it challenges their approach. <This message was edited>

3/22/25, 9:46 PM - Vikranth Bhaiya NFC: My takeaways from the reading this week

- Every pastor leads differently, the ultimate responsibility of the congregation lies on the pastor.
- Submission to God placed authority is of utmost importance and doing it joyfully and humble too, being flexible to change and to be the first to submit helps grow the kingdom in the way God is leading the church. There’s no need to be defensive when offered a change or suggestion.

Take opportunity to discuss to your pastor about new ideas and planning what you’re doing, rather surprising him.

Encourage our pastor and take time to appreciate for everything he does to serve the church. Make a practice to take inputs from your pastor with humility.

Growing spiritually helps us to proclaim the word effectively in leading worship, with basic knowledge by technically equipping us.

Praying for your Pastor with discerning heart helps us see the fruit in serving the church.

A church is built effectively when balanced together as a team.
3/26/25, 9:09 AM - Vikranth Bhaiya NFC: Thank you Ankita and Rachit
3/26/25, 10:09 AM - Hanish Anna Nfc: Thank you Ankita and Rachit.
3/26/25, 10:29 AM - Vikranth Bhaiya NFC: Team if there are no further comments I will post it in the church group..
3/26/25, 10:29 AM - Rachit Bhaiya: Thanks, Vik
3/26/25, 2:36 PM - Berly Akka NFC: Thank you Ankita Rachit Vik
3/28/25, 12:09 PM - Vikranth Bhaiya NFC: Key takeaways 

- Submitting does not negate us from taking the lead for discussing new ideas for worship, it is always better to discuss rather than just surprise the pastor with it. 
- Support to the pastor in worship is not limited to just giving ideas but also taking feedback/input in the right way be it in any form or way. 
- Growth is to happen spiritually, theologically, musically, administratively and technologically. Growth has to be a wholesome experience and not abnormal where only one part of the body is growing. The growth we have benefits all and when we don’t everyone suffers with us. 
-  When in disagreement, choose every way to identify the right issue, exhaust every avenue of resolution and bank on faith for the next way forward. 
- Support is required for all the worship leader and the pastor.
3/28/25, 5:08 PM - Vikranth Bhaiya NFC: Can we meet tomorrow at 8:15 AM for the practise..
3/28/25, 5:21 PM - Rachit Bhaiya: Sure Vik. Works

3/28/25, 9:30 PM - Rachit Bhaiya: My top takeaways:

1.Serve with Initiative & Creativity – Support your pastor while proactively researching, suggesting ideas, and seeking feedback.

2.Prioritize Growth – Strengthen your spiritual, theological, and musical skills to lead effectively.

3.Handle Disagreements Biblically – Address conflicts with humility, prayer, and patience; if necessary, part ways peacefully. <This message was edited>

4/10/25, 5:51 PM - +91 94809 96400: Take aways from the portion given:

Worship is primarily not about singing but actually understanding biblical worship, from the encouragement given by the pastor to make worship leading more fruitful and effective.

Pastors and Worship leaders working hand in hand recognizing and understanding what biblical worship is, that reminds Gods holiness and the superior joy Christ offers us.

As previous chapters reminds us about pursuing humility to serve God in leading worship.
4/11/25, 3:34 PM - Berly Akka NFC: Take away: 
- Pastor learns to recognise his role in leading the worship / team. 
- It begins with understanding the theology of worship. 
- He is the primary worshiper that the congregation looks upto and learns what biblical worship entails. 
- Role of a pastor is beyond teaching and tending , how corporate worship thoughtfully and skilfully led can be also be means to fulfill the goals.

4/25/25, 10:47 PM - Rachit Bhaiya: My key takeaways:

Character over talent: A worship member’s godly character is more important than musical giftedness.

Accountability is crucial: Leaders and members in sin bring disgrace and should be confronted.

Sound theology matters: Worship members should prioritize biblical truth in the songs chosen.

Leading involves more than music: Clear direction and good leadership skills are necessary.
 
Plan and evaluate together: Collaboration in song selection and constructive feedback are essential.

4/26/25, 9:55 AM - +91 79038 33102: My takeaways: 
- Being a part of a worship team is a huge responsibility, it should be seen with a lot of respect and seriousness, especially if you are a worship leader as you are representing Christ, our Saviour. Anyone engaging in any ongoing sin brings disgrace to His name, His church and His mission. It is extremely crucial to self evaluate/ exercise accountability with Pastors/elders if we are engaging in any sinful activity or if we are living a sinful life. 
- ⁠As a worship leader/members, we must love the right theology, which means we must be sound in doctrine. That means we need to be strong in the Word. This raises the importance to consciously take out time and read the Word, and not just read but understand, memorise and internalize the truths that we read in the Word. Unless we are not strong in the Word, we will never be able to discern between right songs. 
- ⁠It is very important to not just choose songs that are groovy but to read through the lyrics: what are the lyrics saying, is it biblically correct or not. 
- ⁠We must equip and encourage worship leaders as a church. I really like the input of sharing videos, CDs, books or sending them for conferences where they can be equipped or upskilled. 
- ⁠We must also support our worship leads to choose songs that will really uplift the congregation. This input really encouraged me to be active on the worship group, we can collectively share suggestions on the worship list for the week.
4/26/25, 3:14 PM - +91 94809 96400: Take aways from the portion given:

Worshiping God with complete humility, which includes the qualities such as self-control, respectability, sober-minded. Team does not entertain any sinful behavior as we represent Christ our savior.

Dwelling in Gods word and not by infatuated culture in church, where music is act of worship, not an idol of worship.

Prioritizing Christ in leading worship, with leadership skills and knowledge in theology.

Support your worship leader by encouraging him as Paul encouraged the Corinthian church, providing him with materials required to grow even more in knowledge of worshiping God.

Word of encouragement and feedback after the worship, helps to plan faithfully. <This message was edited>

4/29/25, 9:14 PM - Rachit Bhaiya: Hi all, 

As we close couple of month, its time we reflect where are we on each pointer. You are encouraged to self assess and see where you can do better. 

We’ll soon have a worship meeting to see what areas are we doing well, what else needs improvement and what new flavours can we bring in. 

On the pointer for joining the prayer calls, again, you are encouraged to be a part of these calls. It happens twice a week and you can be a part of these calls activity or passively but the only request being be in sync for these 10-15 mins of prayer time.
4/29/25, 9:31 PM - Berly Akka NFC: My takeaways: 

- True greatness is always found in pursuing humility. 

- ⁠How you’d want others to treat you, the same way we should balance our evaluation with a large dose of encouragement 

- ⁠It is always a good idea to regularly ask the worship leader/pastor how we can serve effectively. 

- ⁠Sin is deceptive; the enemy works overtime to bring discontent and division in the church. But always resolve conflicts biblically and keep a short account. 

- ⁠God intends our relationship with the worship leader to be one of joy, mutual respect, and fruitfulness. <This message was edited>

Evaluating the worship leader by offering constructive feedback on how they can do better and not emphasizing on every mistake noted.

Approach conflicts biblically with God intended relationship with confidence in his word and dependence in his spirit.

Thanking God for the role of our pastors for not compromising the biblical standards on how our church worship God.
5/2/25, 9:40 PM - Rachit Bhaiya: My takeaways. I feel point 3 is very important to inculcate as a posture in the worship team and broadly within the church. 

1) Embrace Specific, Encouraging Feedback: Just like C.J.'s approach, prioritize specific observations over vague criticisms, always starting with encouragement. Frame constructive feedback as small suggestions that don't diminish the overall worship experience. Pointing out patterns and offering concrete alternatives.

2) Understand the Foundational Power of the Cross: Never mention the cross without some reference to what God accomplished there, is crucial. Remind the team that when selecting songs or leading discussions, always connect the cross to its significance in God's redemptive plan. This ensures that worship is rooted in the core of the Gospel.

3) Cultivate Humility and Proactive Communication: One should ask how they can serve more effectively. This proactive humility can prevent conflicts and foster better communication. Remind ourselves to avoid immediate blame in disagreements and to consider own potential contributions to misunderstandings. Open and honest dialogue is key to resolving conflict biblically.

5/3/25, 6:23 AM - +91 79038 33102: My key takeaways: 
- It’s a good practice to reach out to our worship leader and ask him on how we can serve him and the worship team better.
- ⁠Biblical worship should be the only form of worship that should be done in our church, where through our worship, Christ is glorified.

Hi All, 

Today we hear about the Face Down aspect of worship. When we face up to the glory of God, we fall face down in His reverance. 

Today we hear about:
a) The Glory of God
b) Reverence
c) Posture in worship
6/11/25, 1:41 PM - +91 94809 96400: Thank you Rachit
6/11/25, 1:58 PM - Berly Akka NFC: Thanks Rachit. 
Good reminder to worship God for who He is and our posture reminding again that we are absolutely nothing without Him.
6/11/25, 6:59 PM - Hanish Anna Nfc: Thanks Rachit for sharing of a strong reminder in the posture of worship. <This message was edited>
6/11/25, 7:29 PM - +91 79038 33102: Thanks Rachit for sharing on maintaining the posture of humility and that we are are nothing infront of the King of kings. It is also so important to be hungry and desperate to experience the glory of God during our times of worship. Starting our worship by praying to Him to show His face and reveal His glory is so important.
6/11/25, 9:05 PM - Nophina Akka NFC: Thank you Rachit for sharing this important reminder !!!

Hi All,

A special worship session is planned for the worship team at Central Church this Saturday. 

The heart behind this is to give our team a chance to simply worship without having to think about instruments, cues, or coordinating what’s coming next in the set.

If you’re free *this Saturday* and don’t already have something planned, you’re warmly invited to join. 

This is completely optional, so please feel no pressure.

I would request you to indicate by a quick vote so that logistics can be planned as needed.

Attaching the worship theme and list below. Please let me know in case of any

*Jesus, the Humble Servant-King*

*Philippians 2:5-8*
In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus:
Who, being in very nature[a] God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage;
rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature[b] of a servant, being made in human likeness.
And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death—even death on a cross!
